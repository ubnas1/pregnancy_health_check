This dataset is directly from healthcare IoT devices. The author's source is from Daffodil International University. They are specified to be IoT devices in remote areas. This dataset represents a common instance for data scientists in which collaboration with a subject matter expert could provide a second opinion in terms of the best parameters for cleansing and preprocessing the data.
